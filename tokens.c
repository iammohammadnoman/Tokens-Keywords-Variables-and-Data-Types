//TODO Remember: In total, there are six types of tokens in C programming:-
//? 1. Keywords: Reserved words that have special meaning in C (e.g., int, return, if).
//? 2. Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, arrays, etc. (e.g., main, sum, myVar).
//? 3. Constants: Fixed values that do not change (e.g., 10, 3.14, 'a').
//? 4. String literals: Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!").
//? 5. Operators: Symbols that perform operations on variables and values (e.g., +, -, *, /)
//? 6. Punctuation/Special Symbols: Symbols that separate tokens and define the structure (e.g., ;, ,, {, }).
